brown eyed Kentucky girl she means so much to me\n\nI remember very clearly it was on a warm spring night\nWe declared we loved each other and to marry would be right\nIt was a short time later in the month of July\nOur lives were joined together we were one she and I\n\nMany years have come and gone since the day that we met\nOur love has grown much stronger and it is growing yet\nWe have a happy home and children we have three\nWe still enjoy each other this Kentucky girl and me","_id":"503c2c8581d80c00000000d2","__v":0},{"name":"Brother I'm Getting Ready To

Sewall Yard, was quartered on the line\nAwaiting their strict orders to bring her in on time\n\nAnd when she blew for Hinton, her engineer was there\nGeorge Alley was his name, with bright and wavy hair\nHis fireman, Jack Dickerson, was standing by his side\nReceiving their strict orders, and in the cab to ride\n\nGeorge Alley's mother came to him with a basket on her arm\nShe handed him a

surely hear my call\n\nGeorge Alley said to his fireman, \"Jack, a little extra steam;\nI intend to run old Number 4 the fastest ever seen;\nSo o'er this road I mean to fly like angels' wings unfurled,\nAnd when I blow for the Big Bend Tunnel, they'll surely hear my call\"\n\nGeorge Alley said to his fireman, \"Jack, a rock ahead I see,\nAnd I know that death is lurking there for to grab both you and me\nSo from this cab, dear Jack do fly, your darling life to save\nFor I want you to be an engineer while I'm sleeping in my grave\"\n\n\"Oh no, dear George!

George as Number 4 flew by\n\nSo up the road she dashed, against the rock she crashed\nThe engine turning upside down, and the coaches coming last\nGeorge Alley's head in the firebox lay, while the burning flames rolled high\n\"I'm glad I was born an engineer, on the C and O road to die\"\n\nGeorge Alley's mother came to him and in sorrow she did sigh\nWhen she looked upon her darling boy and

Mountains\nThere lived a maiden fair\nWhose life was pure as heaven\nWhose life was free from care\n\nShe dreamed of love and romance\nWith heart so glad and free\nNo gloom within the future\nYoung Freda Bolt could see\n\nNearby lived dear young Harmon\nA boy she loved so well\nAnd of these two young lovers\nA story I will tell\n\nTwas late one Thursday evening\nThe stars were shinning dim\nThat dear one called his sweetheart\nTo come and go with him\n\nHe told her on tomorrow\nThat they would surely wed\nBut little was she thinking\nHe'd take her life instead\n\nThey motored to Clinch Mountain\nA place so dark and lone\nAnd there her form so helpless\nHe placed beneath the stones\n\nAway from home and mother\nThat Freda loved so well\nThe bitter pain and anguish\nNo mortal tongue can tell\n\nThrough tears she pled for mercy\nThough he denied her cry\nYoung Harmon left his sweetheart\nIn agony to die\n\nWe think that God in heaven\nMust surely heard her cry\nAnd sent a band of angels\nTo linger very nigh\n\nAnd bare her spirit over\nTo yonder happy shore\nWhere dying comes no never\nAnd parting is no more","_id":"503c2cd181d80c00000003c9","__v":0},{"name":"Your Greedy

stray from her frolic for a day\nWill she lie on the rug beside my bed\nLike she did before I went away\n\nWhat will Thomas, the old gardener do\nWhen you ask him for flowers for me\nWill he give you a rose he has tended with care\nThe fairest one that lies around the tree\n\nI saw the tears coming to his honest eyes\nHe said it was the wind that brought 'em there\nAs he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day\nHis hand trembled over my hair\n\nKeep Tag, mother, my little dog\nI know that he'll mourn for me too\nKeep him though blind and older he grows\nTo sleep in the whole summer through\n\nShow him my coat, mother, so he may know\nThat his master then will be dead\nSpeak to him kindly and often of Joe\nAnd pat him on his brown shaggy head\n\nAnd you, dearest mother, shall miss me for a while\nBut in heaven I shall no larger grow\nAnd any kind angel you meet at the gate\nCan take you to your darling Little Joe","_id":"503c2cd581d80c00000003e2","__v":0},{"name":"Little

five\nShe knew I loved her dearly, I told her many times\nAnd I looked forward to the day that she would be all mine\n\nOne more year of school we thought, then wedding bells would ring\nBut the hand of fate has ways of changing everything\nI walked upon the two of them down by the waterfall\nJeniffer and Jimmy Jones they saw me not at all\n\nJimmy Jones was married and had a family\nAnd I just couldn't understand why they did this to me\nBoth were scared but all they thought I'd do was tell his wife\nTheir faces turned to masks of fear before I took their life\n\nPeople thought that Jeniffer just up and ran away\nJimmy Jones who disappeared is a mystery today\nMany years has passed but bitterly I still recall\nAnd only I alone know what's behind the

us all of one size \n\nThere's many a coat that is tatter'd and torn,\nThat beneath lies a true honest heart\nBut because he's not dressed like his neighbors in style,\nWhy \"society\" keeps them apart;\nFor on one fortune smiles, while the other one fails,\nYes no matter what venture he tries,\nBut time calls them both to the grave in the end\nAnd six feet of earth makes us all of one size \n\nThen when you once see a poor fellow that tries,\nTo baffle the world and its frown,\nLet us help him along and perhaps he'll succeed\nDon't crush him because he is down,\nFor a cup of cold water

remember me\n\nI wonder what became of Kathern Ackers\nThe girl who broke my heart at seventeen\nI barely can remember what she looks like\nThirty years ago she was my dream\n\nchorus\n\nFor many

it's motion love\n   If I prove false to thee\n\nOh who will dress your pretty little feet\nAnd who will glove your hand\nOh who will kiss your rosy red cheeks\nWhen I'm in a foreign land\n\nPapa will dress my pretty little feet\nAnd Mama will glove my hand\nYou may kiss my rosy red cheeks\nWhen you return again\n\nHave you seen those mournful doves\nFlying from pine to pine\nA-mournin' for their own true love\nJust like I mourn for mine\n\nI'll never go back on the ocean love\nI'll never go back on the sea\nI'll never go back on my blue-eyed girl\n'Til she goes back on

but I'm a king\nYou are the sweetest song I sing \n\nWell, no one know the love we have dear\nHow two hearts can beat as one\nYour smilin' eyes, way of kissin'\nLovin' touch when the day is done \n\nSome people plan for the future\nThey build a house and save their pay\nThey need a sign to go on livin'\nBut I know a better way.","_id":"503c2d3181d80c00000006dc","__v":0}]}
